                    <p>Everybody wants to learn as long as he lives. Every child desires to go to school to be 
                    able to study, to play with his classmates and to ask help from his teacher. 
                    <br>	
                    How happy he is every time he receives a star from his teacher whenever he behaves in class. 
                    How joyful he feels every time he understands the lesson and be able to interact with the 
                    whole class. Who has a heart to deprive what this young being feels? Who has a heart to stop 
                    this child from living the life he deserves to have? Anybody who has this kind of heart is a 
                    perfect hindrance to an inclusive education.
                    <br>
                    Yes, inclusive education doesn’t choose, doesn’t pick the best and reject the unfortunate. 
                    From the word itself, it includes everyone who has a desire and who has the will to be 
                    provided with education. Whether you know everything or not, whether you live a perfect life 
                    or not, whether you are rich or poor, whether you are capacitated or not, you are still very 
                    much welcome to have the education you always wanted. Everyone is treated fairly, full of just 
                    and love. Everybody is guided onto his ups or downs. Nobody stops anyone from learning and being 
                    educated the way he wants him to be educated. Everybody receives what is right.</p>
